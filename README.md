# hello-world
My first repo on github (!)

I'm trying  to understand how git works. I'm making changes in my first Readme file. 
So I created a branch. And I'm on it.

I also try to learn a little bit markdown language the same time.


# This is my first heading of level 1

## This is my first heading of level 2

###### This is my first heading of level 6    

I love **bold** text in markdown

but maybe I need to know hot to do it in html <strong> gras </strong>  

It's a lot easier in markdown (it seems to be). 

*Italic* in markdown is also _easy_
and _easier_ than in html where it's like <em>this</em>

> I'm now trying to make a blockquote
>
> on two lines
>
>> and a nested block

* Also try to make a bullet 

and that's it for today!
